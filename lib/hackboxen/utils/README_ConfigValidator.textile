h1.  Execution Environment Validator

Hackboxen usually require resources in their execution environment.
If the @Settings@ for a hackbox contains the key @requires@, then its
value must be a hash that declares its requirements.  This
declaration take the form of a tree of hashes.  The value for each key
must be a hash or a simple scalar (e.g. string, number, null). An example declaration:

<pre><code>
requires:
  mysql:
    user: XXXX
    pass: XXXX
    host: XXXX
    port: XXXX
  s3:
    access_key: XXXX
    secret_key: XXXX
  gems:
    ken: null
    configliere: null
    nokogiri: null
  shell_tools:
    wget: null
    tar: null
  jars:
    xerces.jar: 4.5
</code></pre>

If such requirements declaration exists, a @provides@ key must also
exist in @Settings@ and have as its value a hash tree which "covers"
every key in the @requires@ tree.  If a key is missing from @provides@,
then an error is raised (indicating the missing keys) and the hackbox
will fail to run.

**NOTE:** Currently, the scalar values in the leaves of the @requires@
tree are ignored.  Once we have some experience using this
requires/provides mechanism, we will need to define a schema of
convention. (e.g. gems and jar have their minimum versions as values.)
