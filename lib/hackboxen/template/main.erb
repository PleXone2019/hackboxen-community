# A simple example of executable main file. This script is NOT required to be ruby.
#

#
# inputdir is the first argument your main script will get. It will ALWAYS get this. inputdir
# will ALWAYS be a directory that contains (ripd/, rawd/, fixd/, and log/).
#
inputdir  = ARGV[0]

#
# outputdir is the second argument your main script will get. It will ALWAYS get this. outputdir
# will always be a directory that contains (env/). In env/ is where you will find the yaml file
# containing all the configuration settings from ../config/config.yaml.
#
outputdir = ARGV[1]

#
# Example. Reads the yaml file into a ruby hash (same as a javascript associative array, a java
# hashmap, a python dictionary, etc) called 'options'
#
options = YAML.load(File.open(File.join(outputdir, "env", "working_environment.yaml")))
